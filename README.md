# FF4FabulGauntlet
Final Fantasy IV:  Fabul Gauntlet

Welcome to my tenth randomizer, this time from the Pixel Remaster of Final Fantasy IV!  In this randomizer, I have adjusted the maps so that there are 11 areas, 
and at the end of each area (and the middle of a couple areas at the end) is a ten-battle (adjustable) "Fabul Gauntlet".  

This will test how well you can manage your resources as you go through each area.  Enjoy and good luck!

# How to play
Download both the GameAssets.zip and FF4FabulGauntlet.zip files.  Extract only the latter.  Run the EXE, locate your MAIN FF4 PR folder, then click the "extract" button
to load the randomizer resources.  Then set your options, then click "Randomize" and you should be good to go.

# Other notable changes
- This is based off of Memoria, and in that spirit, you can toggle encounters on and off by pressing "F2".
- Edward can equip the Knife.
- The GBA weapons are implemented in Fabul Gauntlet!  (You'll see them more often than not in trap treasure fights in the Lunar Subterranne)
